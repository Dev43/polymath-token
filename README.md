# Performing the airdrop

1. Run `truffle migrate` to deploy the distribution and POLY token contract. Take note of the address of the PolyDistribution contract.
2. Add a csv file named `distrib.csv` to the scripts folder. It should contain one valid address per row.
3. Run `node scripts/csv_allocation.js [ADDRESS of POLYDISTRIBUTION]` This will process the distrib.csv file and transfer 250 POLY to each address.
4. Run `node scripts/review_allocations.js [ADDRESS of POLYDISTRIBUTION] > scripts/review.csv` to retrieve the event log of the distribution and output it to a csv file you can use to compare the intended distribution and the results.
